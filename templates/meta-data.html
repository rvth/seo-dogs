<h2>What is metadata?</h2>

<p>In short, metadata is data, about data. It helps to provide information about a webpage's content and is therefore useful for search engines to better understand websites.</p>

<p>Meta data is used to structure information that is found on a page, in a predictable way that is easy for search engines to understand. For example, meta tags are used to help search engines to determine how relevant a specific page is for a search query. Rather than relying on search engines to have to extract unstructured data from a pages' content, by using metadata you are able to efficiently and effectively provide information about a page's content.</p>

<p>It is important to ensure that metadata is used in a consistent and predictable way to help search engines understand the website and ultimately their ability to index content.</p>

        <br>
