<h1>About SEO Dogs</h1>
    <p>I started this site as a bit of fun, as a place to share basic SEO knowledge with anyone who wants to learn. I want this to be an inclusive space for people with any level of SEO understanding - it won't get too technical, and there will be a dog on every page :)</p>

    <p>A weird 3am insomnia idea in lockdown combined with a couple of rainy weekends and the site was born. I designed and built the site from scratch using Flask, HTML and CSS. I'm not a designer (clearly) or developer, but I have been learning some new skills and wanted to put them into practice, and so here we are.</p>

    <p>I'm a technical SEO by day, animal charity volunteer by night and dog lover all the time, hence the idea for this project, the fundamentals of SEO paired with adoptable dogs.</p>

    <p>If you want to know more about me or this project, feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:ruthx27@gmail.com">email</a> or get in touch via Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/rvtheverett">@rvtheverett</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-everett/">LinkedIn</a>. </p>

<h2>Meet Ember</h2>
    <p>And not to forget the inspiration for it all, my sweet little doggo Ember.</p>
