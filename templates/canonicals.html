<h1>Canonical Tags</h1>
    <img alt="all_dogs" src="{{url_for('static', filename='canonical-dogs.webp')}}" class="responsive">
    <p>There are many <a href="https://wildatheartfoundation.org/adoption-process/">doggos</a> in the world, and each one is unique and special and beautiful, therefore each dog would need a self-referencing canonical tag to highlight their uniqueness. However, some pages on websites may not all be unique, and canonical tags can be used here to prevent duplication.
<h2>What is a canonical tag?</h2>

<p>A canonical tag is a snippet of code that gets added to a page's HTML and is a way of informing search engines of the main version of a page. This is particularly useful if you have duplicate or similar pages across the site. Canonical tags can also be used to inform search engines which URL you want to appear in search results.</p>

<h2>Why are canonical tags used?</h2>

<p>Canonical tags are used to prevent duplicate content issues from arising on your site and within search results. Duplicate content can also affect your crawl budget, where search engine crawlers waste time crawling multiple different versions of the same page, rather than discovering other key pages on the site.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to remember that there can be several ways to access a page, with www. or non www., ending with a trailing slash or no trailing slash or UTM tracking codes for ads, email or social promotion and sometimes dynamically created URLs from CMS platforms that you might not even know exist. These are all seen as unique pages by search engines, so canonical tags can help to solve duplicate content issues which may arise from these.</p>

<h2>Self referencing canonical tags</h2>

<p>It is also recommended to use self-referential canonical tags for pages which you know are unique content and do not have a duplicate to canonicalise to. A self referencing canonical tag is essentially where it points to the same URL. For example, the canonical for this URL would be:
<br>
    <code>link rel="canonical" href="https://www.seo-dogs.co/canonical-tags/"</code>
</p>
<h2>Canonical tag implementation</h2>

<p>Canonical tags are also known as "rel canonical" due to their implementation, using a rel link. For example, if I wanted to canonicalise Page A (https://www.example.com/all-dog-breeds/) to Page B (https://www.example.com/dog-breeds/) the canonical tag I use on Page A will look like this:
<br>
    <code> link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/dog-breeds/" </code>
</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid sending mixed signals through canonical tags, as this can confuse search engines and cause them to ignore the canonicals you set. For example, you wouldn't want to canonicalise Page A to Page B, only to canonicalise Page B back to Page A. Similarly you don't want to canonicalise Page A to Page B and then redirect Page B to Page A.</p>
